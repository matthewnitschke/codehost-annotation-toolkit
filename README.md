# Code Host Annotation Toolkit

A toolkit to add inline annotations to common code hosts like Github, Gitlab, and Bitbucket

## Compatibility

`codehost-annotation-tookit` is still very much in progress. Compatibility is limited based on what I need at the time. PRs/Issues are welcome for additional code host support

### Git Hosts

| Gitlab    | :x:                | :x:                |
| Bitbucket | :x:                | :x:                |

### Code Search

| Name        | Search | Files |
